Homework for Chapter 2 of Learning MySQL (2006 edition), from p. 94:

Exercises:
1) What is command completion?

-- When you type part of a command, press a special key (usually Tab) and the
system inserts the rest of the command (or as much as it can do without
ambiguity).

2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install", or compiled methods?

-- Package is far superior for normal use, as everything is set up for you.
You might want to compile it if you need extra options or performance, but
that's pretty unlikely for this use case! The tarball means it's not installed
system-wide, which means you can keep it to yourself, but the server may not
have root privileges and so you can't bind to low-numbered ports.

3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?

-- MD5 or other hash.

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?

-- Depends on your operating system ;-) I don't, as my package manager sets
it all up for me.

Additional Exercises (not in the book): 
1) Document how you installed MySQL and any issues you came across with installation. 
 (The goal is to be easy to install it again on a similar machine.)

-- As follows:

sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

2) Document where important files should be.

-- dpkg -L <packagename> gives the info, for the following values of
<packagename>:

mysql-client
mysql-client-5.5
mysql-client-core-5.5
mysql-common
mysql-server
mysql-server-5.5
mysql-server-core-5.5
