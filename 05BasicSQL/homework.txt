All exercises here concern the music database, which is available at

I strongly recommend ANSI join style as per 
http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-joins-on-vs-using-vs-theta-style - 
the nutshell is that Theta style is like this:

SELECT ... 
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 
WHERE field1=field2 AND filter=something;

ANSI style is like this:
SELECT ... 
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON (field1=field2) 
WHERE filter=something;

The reason for this is that when you have many tables joined 
it's easier to see the join clause in ON or USING with ANSI style. 
If you join many tables and use theta style, where everything is 
in the WHERE clause, it's possible to forget some of the join clauses 
in the WHERE. If you put the join clauses in the JOIN part, it's way more readable.

1) Use one or more SELECT statements to find out how many tracks are on New Order's Brotherhood album.

mysql> SELECT artist_id FROM artist WHERE artist_name = "New Order";
+-----------+
| artist_id |
+-----------+
|         1 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT album_id FROM album WHERE artist_id = 1 AND album_name = "Brotherhood";
+----------+
| album_id |
+----------+
|        7 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT COUNT(track_id) FROM track WHERE artist_id = 1 AND album_id = 7;
+-----------------+
| COUNT(track_id) |
+-----------------+
|              10 |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)


2) Using a join, list the albums that we own by the band New Order

<<<<<<< HEAD
mysql> SELECT album_name FROM album INNER JOIN artist ON (artist.artist_id = album.artist_id) WHERE artist_name = "New Order";
+------------------------------------------+
| album_name                               |
+------------------------------------------+
| Retro - John McCready FAN                |
| Substance (Disc 2)                       |
| Retro - Miranda Sawyer POP               |
| Retro - New Order / Bobby Gillespie LIVE |
| Power, Corruption & Lies                 |
| Substance 1987 (Disc 1)                  |
| Brotherhood                              |
+------------------------------------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)


3) With INSERT statements, add the artist Leftfield to the database. For this new artist, add the album "Leftism" that has
the following tracks:

3) With INSERT statements, add the artist Leftfield to the database. 
For this new artist, add the album "Leftism" that has the following tracks:
>>>>>>> upstream/master
a. Release the Pressure (Time: 7.39)
b. Afro-Melt (Time: 7.33)
c. Melt (Time: 5.21)
d. Song of Life (Time: 6.55)
e. Original (Time: 6.00)
f. Black Flute (Time: 3.46)
g. Space Shanty (Time: 7.15)
h. Inspection Check One (Time: 6.30)
i. Storm 3000 (Time: 5.44)
j. Open Up (Time: 6.52)
k. 21st Century Poem (Time: 5.42)
l. Bonus Track (Time: 1.22)

The answer to this question should be the INSERT statement(s).

mysql> INSERT INTO artist SET artist_id = 8, artist_name = "Leftfield";
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO album SET artist_id = 8, album_id = 1, album_name = "Leftism";
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO track VALUES (1, "Release the Pressure", 8, 1, 7.39);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO track VALUES (2, "Afro-Melt", 8, 1, 7.33), (3, "Melt", 8, 1, 5.21), (4, "Song of Life", 8, 1, 6.55), (5, "Original", 8, 1, 6.00), (6, "Black Flute", 8, 1, 3.46), (7, "Space Shanty", 8, 1, 7.15), (8, "Inspection Check One", 8, 1, 6.30), (9, "Storm 3000", 8, 1, 5.44), (10, "Open Up", 8, 1, 6.52), (11, "21st Century Poem", 8, 1, 5.42), (12, "Bonus Track", 8, 1, 1.22);
Query OK, 11 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 11  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0


4) How long in minutes is the Leftism album you added in Question 3? Hint: use the
SUM() aggregate function.

mysql> SELECT SUM(time) FROM track WHERE artist_id = 8 AND album_id = 1;
+-----------+
| SUM(time) |
+-----------+
|     67.99 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Except doesn't that assume that there are 100 seconds in a minute? The "time" column is defined, rather oddly, as a "decimal(5,2)". 


5) Change the time for the Original track on the Leftism album to 6.22.

mysql> UPDATE track SET time = 6.22 WHERE artist_id = 8 and album_id = 1 AND track_name = "Original";
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0


6) Remove the 'Bonus Track' from the Leftism album,

mysql> DELETE FROM track WHERE artist_id = 8 AND album_id = 1 AND track_name = "Bonus Track";
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
