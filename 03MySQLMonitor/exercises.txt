1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

-- The database runs as a server process and responds to requests made by
multiple client applications, which may run on the same or different machines,
and may start and stop working without affecting the server.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

-- In interactive mode, you type commands and it shows you responses. In batch
mode, you put the commands in a file and it executes them all without stopping.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

-- Allow you to specify the username and password with which to authenticate,
and the initial database to start using. (Without that, you have to
USE <databasename> before doing any database operations.)
